# Face Tracking and smileys w/ Raspberry and Arduino

Project made by Pierre-Jean Berthelon & Florian Bucheron.

Result and tutorial of this project can be found here : link to youtube video.

This project uses Raspberry, OpenCV libraries and servo motors to detect and follow a face on a video. Once a face is detected, we track it. The program also includes a smile and eyes detection, which allows to draw a smiley on the Raspberry's SenseHat module.  

This repository contains everything you need to run the project. 
Needed Hardware:
 - Raspberry model 3 (or other) 
 - SenseHat module
 - Raspicam
 - Arduino (Uno used in this project) with a 9V battery supply (the servos use too much power just for the usb)
 - Two Servo motors connected to the Arduino.
 
You just need to:
  - Download the repository on your computer.
  - Run ProjetSY25Berthelon_Bucheron on QT creator (install opencv module before)
  - Run ControlMoteurArduino on Arduino IDE
  - Enjoy !
